       My name is Nadia and I am a Web Developer.  I was drawn to web development because it was a field that was growing rapidly and it was exciting to find out more about it. I love the problem solving aspect of the profession and also the opportunity to collaborate with people.  I work in JavaScript, NodeJS, AngularJS, React, Ruby on Rails among other frameworks and languages. My prior experiences as a bookkeeper and the owner of a moving company taught me to work under pressure, meet deadlines and become a great teammate. I know that it is a necessity to dedicate 100% of your time in order to be  come good in something.
